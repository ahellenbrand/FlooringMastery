# FlooringMastery
Flooring Mastery project for Software Guild using Java and Spring MVC.

I completed the Flooring Mastery project using the NetBeans IDE.  The Flooring Mastery project is a CRUD application that uses a layered MVC architecture to track flooring orders.  The Spring Framework library was added to the application's Maven POM.xml file and then the dependencies were injected through a Spring application context file.  I created unit tests using JUnit on both the data and service layers to ensure my code was working correctly.
